## README

The chapters of this book occur on a time-line that 
runs chronologically from the eariliest developments of 
the Aryan myth to the present. While the chapters are 
not strictly chronological, they have been arranged with 
a historial narratrive in mind.  

## A Note About This Book

This book occasionally uses words whose meanings have 
changed over time, and in some cases remain actively debated.
In almost every case, the editors have tried to trace traditional 
meanings—and highlight the ways Indology has shaped discourse. 

## Epigraph 

> अविरोधितया कर्म नाविद्यां विनिवर्तयेत् । <br>
> विद्याविद्या निहन्त्येव तेजस्तिमिरसङ्ववत् ॥ 
>
> *avirodhitayã karma nävidyam vinivartayet* । <br> 
> *vidyavidyam nihantyeva tejastimirasamghavat* ॥
>
> Action cannot destroy ignorance, as it is not opposed to ignorance <br>
> Knowledge does verily destroy ignorance just as light destroys deep darkness (_Ātmabodha_ 3)[^4]

[^1]: With respect to this term, it is quite possible that Freire was 
   inspired by Fanon, who coined the term conscienciser (or “to bring to 
   consciousness”) in Peau noir, masques blancs (Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 
   1952), p. 80: “Ce qui apparaît alors, c'est la nécessité d'une action 
   couplée sur l'individu et sur le groupe. En tant que psychanalyste, 
   je dois aider mon client à conscienciser son inconscient, à ne plus 
   tenter une lactification hallucinatoire, mais bien à agir dans kle sens 
   d'un changement des structures sociales (Ficek 46).”

[^2]: કલા, Classical form of કળા An art (Belsare 227) + નગર a city (Belsare 301).
    
[^3]: તન-મન-ધન a. n. \[See તન + મન + ધન\] Lit. The body, the mind, and
    one’s wealth. Hence, 2. All that one loves; the highest object of
    one’s ambition (Belsare 577).

[^4]: Action—Which is associated with the consciousness of doer,
    instrument, and result.

    Knowledge—Of Non-duality.

    Ignorance—Which conjures up the multiplicity of the relative world.
    (See note on verse 5, p. 160). Ignorance must not be confused with
    illiteracy or absence of book-knowledge. Vedanta declares that the
    Knowledge of the non-duality of Brahman and Ātman is the only true
    Knowledge; all else is ignorance. Any trace of duality belongs to
    the state of ignorance. As such, the vision of a god or the
    experience of happiness in heaven belongs to the realm of ignorance
    (Swami Nikhilānand 157).

[^5]: I was maybe fifteen or sixteen when I first came across the 
    date 1619. Whenever I think about that moment, my mind conjures 
    an image of glowing three-dimensional numbers rising from the page. 
    Of course, in reality, they were printed in plain black text on 
    the cheap page of a paperback. Still, while the numbers did not 
    literally glow, I remember sitting back in my chair and staring 
    at the date, a bit confused, thrown off-kilter by an exhilarating 
    revelation starting to sink in (Hannah-Jones xvii).
